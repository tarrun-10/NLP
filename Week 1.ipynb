       "\"As a result , although we still make use of this distinction , there is much confusion as to the meaning of the basic terms employed . Just what is meant by `` spirit '' and by `` matter '' ? ? The terms are generally taken for granted as though they referred to direct and axiomatic elements in the common experience of all . Yet in the contemporary context this is precisely what one must not do . For in the modern world neither `` spirit '' nor `` matter '' refer to any generally agreed-upon elements of experience . We are in a transitional stage in which many of the connotations of former usage have had to be revised or rejected . When the words are used , we are never sure which of the traditional meanings the user may have in mind , or to what extent \""

       "\"Thank you . Thank you so much . Vice President Biden , Mr . Chief Justice , Members of the United States Congress , distinguished guests , and fellow citizens : Each time we gather to inaugurate a President we bear witness to the enduring strength of our Constitution . We affirm the promise of our democracy . We recall that what binds this Nation together is not the colors of our skin or the tenets of our faith or the origins of our names . What makes us exceptionalâ \\x80\\x94 what makes us Americanâ \\x80\\x94 is our allegiance to an idea articulated in a declaration made more than two centuries ago : We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal ; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights ; that among these are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . Today we continue a never - ending journey to bridge the meaning of those words with the realities of our time . For history tells us that while these truths may be self - evident , they ' ve never been self - executing ; that while freedom is a gift from God , it must be secured by His people here on Earth . The patriots of 1776 did not fight to replace the tyranny of a king with the privileges of a few or the rule of a mob . They gave to us a republic , a government of and by and for the people , entrusting each generation to keep safe our founding creed . And for more than 200 years , we have . Through blood drawn by lash and blood drawn by sword , we learned that no union founded on the principles of liberty and equality could survive half - slave and half - free . We made ourselves anew , and vowed to move forward together . Together , we determined that a modern economy requires railroads and highways to speed travel and commerce , schools and colleges to train our workers . Together , we discovered that a free market only thrives when there are rules to ensure competition and fair play . Together , we resolved that a great nation must care for the vulnerable and protect its people from life ' s worst hazards and misfortune . Through it all , we have never relinquished our skepticism of central authority nor have we succumbed to the fiction that all society ' s ills can be cured through government alone . Our celebration of initiative and enterprise , our insistence on hard work and personal responsibility , these are constants in our character . But we have always understood that when times change , so must we ; that fidelity to our founding principles requires new responses to new challenges ; that preserving our individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action . For the American \""
